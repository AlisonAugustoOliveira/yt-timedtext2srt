to something more like this:

```
0
00:00:03,934 --> 00:00:05,400
Narrator: Legends.

1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,700
Stories scattered through time.

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,660
Mankind has grown quite fond
of recounting the exploits

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,960
of heroes and villains,
forgetting so easily

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,280
that we are remnants, byproducts, of a forgotten past.

5
00:00:19,767 --> 00:00:24,307
Man, born from dust, was strong,
wise, and resourceful.

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,660
But he was born into an unforgiving world.

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,620
An inevitable darkness, creatures of destruction.

8
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,533
The creatures of Grimm set
their sights on man

9
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:37,433
and all of his creations.

```
