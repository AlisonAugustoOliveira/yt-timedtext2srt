00:00:03,934 --> 00:00:05,400
Narrator: Legends.

1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,700
Stories scattered through time.

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,660
Mankind has grown quite fond
of recounting the exploits

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,960
of heroes and villains,
forgetting so easily

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,280
that we are remnants, byproducts, of a forgotten past.

5
00:00:19,767 --> 00:00:24,307
Man, born from dust, was strong,
wise, and resourceful.

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,660
But he was born into an unforgiving world.

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,620
An inevitable darkness, creatures of destruction.

8
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,533
The creatures of Grimm set
their sights on man

9
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:37,433
and all of his creations.

10
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:41,746
These forces clashed and it seemed the darkness was intent

11
00:00:41,746 --> 00:00:45,300
on returning man's brief existence to the void.

12
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:49,200
However, even the
smallest spark of hope

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,960
is enough to ignite change
and in time, man's passion,

14
00:00:53,967 --> 00:00:57,380
resourcefulness and ingenuity led them to the tools

15
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,480
that would help even the odds.

16
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,734
This power was appropriately named, "Dust".

17
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,940
Nature's wrath in hand, man lit their way through the darkness

18
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,834
and in the shadow's absence, came strength, civilization

19
00:01:12,834 --> 00:01:15,614
and most importantly,
life.

20
00:01:17,767 --> 00:01:22,33
But even the most brilliant lights
eventually flicker and die.

21
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,440
And when they are gone...

22
00:01:27,867 --> 00:01:29,827
...darkness will return.

23
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,580
So, you may prepare
your guardians...

24
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:44,433
build your monuments to a
so-called free world

25
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,560
but take heed...

26
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,220
there will be no
victory in strength.

27
00:01:52,60 --> 00:01:54,920
Ozpin: But perhaps victory is in
the simpler things that

28
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,320
you've long forgotten.

29
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,740
Things that require a
smaller, more honest soul.

30
00:02:13,40 --> 00:02:16,180
Roman: Do you have any idea
how hard it is to find

31
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,920
a Dust shop open this late?

32
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,920
Shop owner:  P-please!

33
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,80
Just take my Lien and leave!

34
00:02:20,80 --> 00:02:23,720
Roman: Shhh, calm down, we're not
here for your money.

35
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,720
Grab the dust.

36
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,960
Henchman: Crystals.

37
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,920
Burn. Uncut.

38
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,320
Henchman: Alright kid, put your
hands where I can see 'em.

39
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,380
Hey, I said hands in the air!

40
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,980
You got a death
wish or something!?

41
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,520
Ruby: Huh?

42
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:57,760
Yes?

43
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,520
Henchman: I said, put your
hands in the air, now!

44
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,500
Ruby: Are you...

45
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,360
robbing me?

46
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,640
Henchman: Yes!

47
00:03:04,60 --> 00:03:05,200
Ruby: Oh.

48
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:06,740
Henchman: Hey!
Ruby: Hyah!

49
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,80
Henchman: Freeze!

we're waiting for. ♪

57
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,380
Get her!

58
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,767
- You were worth every cent.

59
00:03:57,767 --> 00:03:58,907
Truly, you were.

60
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,380
Well, Red, I think we can all say
it's been an eventful evening,

61
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,580
and as much as I'd
love to stick around...

62
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,787
I'm afraid this is
where we part ways.

63
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,40
Ruby: You okay if I go after him?

64
00:04:25,80 --> 00:04:25,840
Shop owner: Uh huh.

65
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,480
Ruby: Hey!

66
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,720
Roman: Persistent...

67
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,0
End of the line, Red.

68
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,720
Whoa-ho-ho!

69
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:57,860
Huh?

70
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,0
- We got a Huntress!

71
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,980
The hell...?

72
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,60
Ruby: You're a Huntress!

73
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:30,286
Can I have your autograph?

74
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,860
Glynda: I hope you realize that
your actions tonight

75
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,680
will not be taken lightly,
young lady.

76
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,700
You put yourself and
others in great danger.

77
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,0
Ruby: They started it!

78
00:06:39,0 --> 00:06:41,520
Glynda: If it were up to me,
you'd be sent home...

79
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,740
With a pat on the back...

80
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,833
And a slap on the wrist.

81
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:48,800
Ruby: Eeek!

82
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,940
Glynda: But... there is someone here
who would like to meet you.

83
00:06:57,80 --> 00:06:58,847
Ozpin: Ruby Rose...

84
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,740
You...

85
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,240
have silver eyes.

86
00:07:06,40 --> 00:07:06,940
Ruby: Um...

87
00:07:07,60 --> 00:07:07,880
Ozpin: So!

88
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,280
Where did you learn to do this?

89
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,880
Ruby: S-Signal Academy.

90
00:07:13,80 --> 00:07:15,360
Ozpin: They taught you to use one
of the most dangerous

91
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,640
weapons ever designed?

92
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,200
Ruby: Well, one teacher
in particular.

93
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,580
Ozpin: I see...

94
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,380
It's just that I've only seen
one other scythe-wielder

95
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,820
of that skill before.

96
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,460
A dusty, old crow.

97
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,220
Ruby: Mmmm!

98
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,420
Thash muh unkul!

99
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,480
Sorry, that's my Uncle Qrow!

100
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,160
He's a teacher at Signal!

101
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,160
I was complete garbage before
he took me under his wing.

102
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,280
And now I'm all
like-- Hooowaaah!

103
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,740
Witchaaaa!

104
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,960
ozpin: So I've noticed.

105
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:54,220
And what is an adorable girl
such as yourself

106
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,920
doing at a school designed
to train warriors?

107
00:07:57,66 --> 00:08:00,746
Ruby: Well...
I want to be a Huntress.

108
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,840
Ozpin: You want to slay monsters?

109
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:03,900
Ruby: Yeah!

110
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,900
I only have two more years
of training left at Signal!

111
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,560
And then I'm going
to apply to Beacon!

112
00:08:08,767 --> 00:08:10,467
You see, my sister's
starting there this year,

113
00:08:10,467 --> 00:08:11,727
and she's trying to become
a Huntress,

114
00:08:11,727 --> 00:08:14,533
and I'm trying to become a Huntress 'cause I wanna help people.

115
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,640
My parents always taught us to
help others, so I thought,

116
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,0
'Hey, I might as well make
a career out of it!'

117
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,260
I mean the police are alright,
but Huntsman and Huntresses

118
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,920
are just so much more
romantic and exciting

119
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,180
and really, gosh, you know!

120
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,180
Ozpin: Do you know who I am?

121
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,960
Ruby: You're Professor Ozpin.

122
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,120
You're the headmaster of Beacon.

123
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:36,880
Ozpin: Hello.

124
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,140
Ruby: Nice to meet you.

125
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,420
Ozpin: You want to come to my school?

126
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,860
Ruby: More than anything.

127
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,740
Glynda: Hmmph.

128
00:08:45,60 --> 00:08:46,140
Ozpin: Well okay.

129
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,240
Yang: Oh, I can't believe my
baby sister is going

130
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,120
to Beacon with me!

131
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,980
This is the best day ever!

132
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,667
Ruby: Please stop.

133
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,166
Yang: But I'm so proud of you!

134
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,66
Ruby: Really, Sis, it was nothing.

135
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,380
Yang: What do you mean?
It was incredible!

136
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,280
Everyone at Beacon is going to
think you're the bee's knees.

137
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,620
Ruby: I don't want to be
the "bee's knees", okay?

138
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,280
I don't wanna be
any kind of knees!

139
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,940
I just want to be a normal
girl with normal knees.

140
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,60
Yang: What's with you?
Aren't you excited?

141
00:09:13,60 --> 00:09:14,227
Ruby: Of course I'm excited...

142
00:09:14,227 --> 00:09:15,87
I just...

143
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,260
I got moved ahead two years.

144
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,860
I don't want people to think
I'm special or anything.

145
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,900
Yang: But you are special.

146
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,920
News reporter: ...The robbery was led by
nefarious criminal

147
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,160
Roman Torchwick, who continues
to evade authorities.

148
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,266
If you have any information
on his whereabouts

149
00:09:30,266 --> 00:09:32,726
please contact the
Vale Police Department.

150
00:09:32,726 --> 00:09:33,906
Back to you, Lisa.

151
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,340
Lisa: Thank you, Cyril.

152
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,834
In other news, this Saturday's
Faunus Civil Right's protest

153
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:41,533
turned dark when
members of the White Fang

154
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:43,400
disrupted the ceremony.

155
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,900
The once peaceful
organization has now disrupted...

156
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,200
Glynda: Hello, and welcome to Beacon!

157
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:53,480
Yang: Who's that?

158
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,140
Glynda: My name is Glynda Goodwitch.

159
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,740
Yang: Oh.

160
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,660
Glynda: You are among a privileged few
who have received the honor of

161
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,500
being selected to attend
this prestigious academy!

162
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,80
Our world is experiencing an
incredible time of peace,

163
00:10:05,80 --> 00:10:07,580
and as future Huntsman
and Huntresses,

164
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,533
it is your duty to uphold it.

165
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:12,973
You have demonstrated the
courage needed for such a task,

166
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,940
and now, it is our turn to provide
you with the knowledge

167
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,380
and the training to
protect our world.

168
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,680
Ruby: Wow!

169
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,520
Look, you can see
Signal from up here!

170
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,160
- I guess home isn't
too far after all!

171
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,40
Yang: Beacon's our home, now.

172
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,953
- Well... I guess the view
isn't for everyone.

173
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,480
Ruby: It was a nice moment
while it lasted.

174
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:53,47
I wonder who we're gonna meet.

175
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,480
Ruby: I just hope they're better
than "Vomit Boy".

176
00:10:55,934 --> 00:10:58,914
- Oh, Yang, gross, you have puke
on your shoe!

177
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,840
